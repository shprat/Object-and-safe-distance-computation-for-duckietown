### Run the program
1. Object Detection
        
      - In shell 1:
     
       $ rosrun image_transport republish compressed in:=/duckduckgopls/camera_node/image raw out:=/duckduckgopls/camera_node/image/raw
       
       
      - In shell 2:
     
       $ roscd duckduckgopls/scripts/
       $ python detect_and_publish.py
       
      - In shell 3:
       
       $ dts start_gui_tools duckduckgopls
       # rqt_image_view
       
2. Safe Distance Alarm
      - In shell 4:

       $ python safe_distance.py
